              "\"Here is a Python code that prints all prime numbers up to a given number:\\n```\\ndef is_prime(n):\\n    if n <= 1:\\n        return False\\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\\n        if n % i == 0:\\n            return False\\n    return True\\n\\ndef print_primes(n):\\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\\n        if is_prime(i):\\n            print(i)\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nprint_primes(30)  # prints all prime numbers up to 30\\n```\\nHere's an explanation of the code:\\n\\nThe `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it is prime, and `False` otherwise. It does this by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1 (in which case it is not prime), or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself (in which case it is not prime). The `range` function is used to iterate from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), and the `if` statement checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers.\\n\\nThe `print_primes` function takes an integer `n` as input and prints all prime numbers up to `n`. It does this by iterating from 2 to `n` (inclusive) and calling the `is_prime` function for each number. If the number is prime, it is printed.\\n\\nYou can modify the `print_primes` function to print all prime numbers up to a specific number by changing the range of the `for` loop. For example, to print all prime numbers up to 100, you would use `print_primes(100)`.\\n\\nNote that this code uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is not the most efficient method for large numbers. For larger numbers, you may want to use a more advanced primality test, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test.\""
